    - (29) Step 13 - Introduction to Variables in Java
        - Declared and initialized variables 
        - Printed output using % formatter
    - (30) Step 14 - Introduction to Variables in Java - Exercises and Puzzles
        - Learned about lossy conversions
            - In lossy conversion there is a loss in data from bigger data types to smaller data types
                ```
                 int i =98765432;
                jshell> short sh = i;
                |  Error:
                |  incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to short
                |  short sh = i;

                - For explicit conversion
                jshell> short sh = (short)i;
                sh ==> 2680
                ```
        - Printed output using % formatter

            ```
            int 2things
            |  Error:
            |  '.class' expected
            |  int 2things
            |      ^
            |  Error:
            |  not a statement
            |  int 2things
            |       ^----^
            |  Error:
            |  unexpected type
            |    required: value
            |    found:    class
            |  int 2things
            |  ^--^

            jshell> int things2
            things2 ==> 0
            ```
