Question 1:
What is the output of the following code snippet?
int i = 10;
if(i < 5) {
    System.out.println("i is less than 5");
} else if(i > 20) {
    System.out.println("i is greater than 20");
} else {
    System.out.println("i is between 5 and 20");
}
- i is between 5 and 20

Question 2:
What is the output of the following code snippet?
int i = 15;
if(i < 5) {
    System.out.println("i is less than 5");
} else if(i > 20) {
    System.out.println("i is greater than 20");
} else if(i < 10) {
    System.out.println("i is less than 10");
} else {
    System.out.println("i is between 10 and 20");
}
- i is between 10 and 20

Question 3:
What is the output of the following code snippet?
public static void puzzleOne() {
    int k = 15;
    if(k > 20) {
        System.out.println(1);
    } else if(k > 10) {
        System.out.println(2);
    } else if(k < 20) {
        System.out.println(3);
    } else {
        System.out.println(4);
    }
}
